Tip #1: Do not put plastic bags into your home's recycling. They will clog up the recycling machine. This includes bags that are used to hold other recyclables. Everything in that bag will be considered trash. If you have grocery bags check your local grocery store for a recylcing bin where they can be disposed of.
Tip #2: Do not recycle anything smaller than a credit card. Small recyclables can clog the machines.
Tip #3: If it's not clean, empty, and dry, do not recycle!
Tip #4: If it containes two or more materials(such as paper and plastic), it is not recyclable.
Tip #5: Look for the recycling code. The lower it is, the more recyclable. Typically, recylcing centers are equipped to recycle items with a code of one or two.
Tip #6: If you are unsure if something is recyclable or not, throw it in the trash. It it goes into the recycling and it isn't recycable, it could contaminate the rest of the recycables.
